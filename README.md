Booldozer is a work-in-progress editor for the original [Luigi's Mansion on GameCube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi%27s_Mansion), written by SpaceCats ([@kittensandals](https://twitter.com/kittensandals)) and Gamma ([@SageOfMirrors](https://twitter.com/SageOfMirrors)). It aims to cover as many aspects of modding the game as possible.

Keeping track of create names manually is a thing of the past! Use Booldozer's Spawn Group Editor to make managing waves of enemies as easy as clicking and dragging.
